Some scripts etc which I have written and use to make my git life easier

makegitbundle	- before I started using github (or if I don't want to)
		  I use git bundle archives locally to backup, move git repos
		  around. This script makes my life a bit easier.
mext-header	- Not a script in itself but a file used by the above.

		- I am indebted to people who gave me the starting point for
		  this script by publishing their tips in blogs etc., particularly
		  Emanuel Vianna at http://tiny.cc/h003x and Stuart Wells (http://www.stuartwells.net/slides/selfextract.htm) 

git-summary	- prints a short summary about a git repo to stdout
