Some scripts etc which I have written and use to make my git life easier

makegitbundle	- before I started using github (or if I don't want to)
		  I use git bundle archives locally to backup, move git repos
		  around. This script makes my life a bit easier

git-summary	- prints a short summary about a git repo to stdout
