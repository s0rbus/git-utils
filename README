Some scripts etc which I have written and use to make my git life easier

makegitbundle	- before I started using github (or if I don't want to)
		  I use git bundle archives locally to backup, move git repos
		  around. This script makes my life a bit easier.
mext-header	- Not a script in itself but a file used by the above.

		- I am indebted to people who gave me the starting point for
		  this script by publishing their tips in blogs etc., particularly
		  Emanuel Vianna at http://tiny.cc/h003x and Stuart Wells (http://www.stuartwells.net/slides/selfextract.htm) 

git-summary	- prints a short summary about a git repo to stdout

remgit - Based on a script from Christopher Kalima (https://gist.github.com/ckalima), it creates
	a remote (which can actually be local, just remote from current dir) git repository, inits
	current dir as a git repo if it isn't already and sets remote as 'origin'.
